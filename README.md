# Scratch-Ye-Heads !!!

Programming forcing to Scratch your Heads.....

No worries we got you covered. In this event we will be learning basic programmming while developing
mini-games.

What you waiting for now ?!.... Start Scratching !!!

## Setting Up the Environment ( Estimated Time : 5 mins )
- Create an account on [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/)
- Verify your email
- All further tasks will be held on this platform for this contest

## Basics of Scratch ( Estimated Time : 5 mins )
- Checkout the Panels Labelled : `Code`, `Costumes` and `Sound` 
- While the `Code` panel is selected you can look into various differently labelled code blocks on the left : `Motion` , `Sensing` , `Control` etc
- Drag and Drop Blocks of code to set up your logic
- The stage where the output will be shown is already set up and the characters are implemented.
- Just think of the logic and drag-n-drop blocks and progress.

## Output Format:
- Make a word file locally and save as `Scratch`
- Make Sure you save the project as sharable. Click on `Share` at the top to make the project sharable.
- Copy link of the project and save it in the word file with Task1/ Task2/ Task3 as the heading.

## Task 1 : DVD Theater ( Estimated Time : 5 mins ) 

`Will the logo ever hit the corner? To find out you will have to make it bounce!`

### Objective
- Make the DVD logo move and bounce in a manner similar to the gif

### Project Setup:
- Open this [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/924379495/) IN A NEW TAB and click on `Remix`

### Hints and Clues:
- `Motion`,`Control` and `Sensing` is used
- Look at the sprites, they play an important role in `Sensing`.
- Make Sure the logo is selected in while coding. You can select a particular game element by clicking on the images shown on the bottom right

## Task 2 : Hole In Multiple ( Estimated Time : 35 mins )

`John's friends challenged him to pot the ball in how many ever bounces they say. John, the WICKed, accepted the challenge. Now its up to you to help the numbskull get out of this situation`

![](https://github.com/DarthBob112112/Scratch-Ye-Heads/blob/main/assets/tom-and-jerry-tom.gif)

### Objective  
- Return the angle at which the ball will exit after exactly x bounces
- Bonus: Return a list of all the angles which will solve the problem

### Project Setup:
- Open this [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/763982841/) IN A NEW TAB and click on `Remix`
<!--change project link -->
### Hints and Clues:
- The better the solution, the more marks you get
- Color plays an important role in `Sensing`
- New Variables can be made by going to `Variables` option on the left
- Some variables are already created for you. Try creating some more variables to solve the task
- Bruteforcing is a possible solution!

## Task 3 : Practice For FIFA World Cup ( Estimated Time : 55 mins )
`NOW IS ALL: Live your dream, Realise your destiny â€“ and Own the moment`

### Objective
- Help the midfield player achieve different configurations while passing.

### Project Setup:
- Open this [link](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/763984802/) IN A NEW TAB and click on `Remix`

### Hints and Clues:
- List Functions can be seen in the `Variables` option on the left
- Apply code snippets on the ball
- Variable: `config`, denotes the formation in which the players pass. 
- Lists: 1) `X1` `Y1` 2) `X2` `Y2` 3)  `X3` `Y3` 4) `Config_Name` 
- The Lists `X1` `Y1` and others have to be used together as (x,y) to mark the ball's position.
- Use if else branching to make the player say the configuration name using `Config_Name` list.  
- Use if else branching on the `config` variable.
